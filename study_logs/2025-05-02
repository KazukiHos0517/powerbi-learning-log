📚 What I studied today
Udemy Power BI course (continued)

Focused on slicers, filters, and effective visual design

✍️ Insights / Notes
Using slicers allows users to focus on specific data subsets.

Deciding where to place each piece of information (e.g., filters, fields) is not always straightforward.

Filters can be applied individually to each visual and determine what data is shown (e.g., in cards).

Renaming a data field will update the name across all visuals where it's used.

Choosing appropriate titles for visuals is critical for clarity and user understanding.

Slicers can be configured to allow single or multiple selections.

The default page visible after publishing can impact how the report is perceived—consider which page to leave open.
