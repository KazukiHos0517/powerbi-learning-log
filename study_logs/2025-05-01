📚 What I studied today
Udemy Power BI course (Section 9 and onwards)

Practiced matrix visuals and map settings

Learned about tenant-level account settings and report-level permissions

✍️ Insights / Notes
Visuals can be copied and duplicated easily within reports.

Some account settings are controlled at the tenant level, so changes made in Power BI Desktop might not take effect if overridden by admin settings.

Map visuals can be tricky due to permission and admin management complexity.

Matrix visual is effective for displaying raw Excel data in a structured format.

When replacing a dataset, re-sharing with other users is not required—they will automatically see the updated version upon refresh.

🎯 Next steps
Continue with Udemy course Section 10

Experiment more with different visual types (especially map and matrix)

Review dataset permission settings and tenant-level behavior
