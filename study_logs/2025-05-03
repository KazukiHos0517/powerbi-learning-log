Udemy Power BI course (Sections 11–12)

Explored themes, slicer synchronization, drillthrough pages, and custom visuals

✍️ Insights / Notes
Copilot can generate explanations for visuals automatically.

Slicers can be synchronized across multiple report pages.

Themes can be customized in advance. A light gray background (#D6D6D6) is a popular choice.

Shadows can enhance visuals but must be set manually—theme JSON files can't handle shadow settings.

If a theme doesn't apply correctly, using the “Reset to default” option can resolve the issue.

From the data pane, columns can be configured to display as icons, URLs, etc. You can also choose to show only the icon for a URL.

Quick measures enable creation of calculated data not available in Excel.

Drillthrough pages can be created with navigation buttons that connect between pages.

Third-party visuals can be imported via the custom visuals marketplace.

Mastering DAX functions allows for flexible creation of custom columns and calculations.

🎯 Next steps
