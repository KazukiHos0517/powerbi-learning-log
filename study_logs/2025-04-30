## 📚 What I studied today
- Studied Power BI through Geek Fujiwara’s Udemy course (completed up to Chapter 8)
- Learned how dashboard publishing and sharing works in Power BI
- Explored workspace usage and how to manage shared reports and permissions
- Investigated how number formatting and data source paths affect reports

## ✍️ Insights / Notes
- Once a report is shared via Power BI Service, viewers can always access the latest data
- Power BI Pro licenses are required per user for sharing workspaces and dashboards
- For personal use, the desktop version is free, but issues on the cloud version aren't guaranteed support
- If a data file’s location changes, the data source path must be manually reconnected via “Data source settings”
- Numeric formatting needs careful attention—automatic settings may show units like “K” or “M,” which can be removed but reduce readability
- Localization (e.g., Japanese number formats) is technically possible with configuration
- Once a dashboard is complete, the "Publish" button becomes available, uploading the report to the selected workspace
- A workspace is like a folder that stores `.pbix` files and datasets for web-based access
- Permissions can be set when sharing from a workspace

## 🎯 Next steps
- Resume Udemy course from Chapter 9
- Practice publishing a sample dashboard to a workspace
- Explore how to localize visuals for Japanese display standards
- Begin planning a reusable GitHub-ready dashboard template
